### reactjs-enphase-solar-display

# Purpose

To create a webpage that can display the solar data from the enphase api on a digital display board via xibo CMS.

# Features

Using reactjs so the data can be dynamically refresh while the digital display board is displaying solar info webpage.

# Design

The client required that the solar layout be simple with only four piece of information displayed; they also wanted something
that would catch people's eye, so I decided to use a EV battery to compare how much life time energy had been collected.
